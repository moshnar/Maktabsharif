<p align="center"><img src="jack.png" width="200" height="300" alt="Jack"></p>

<p>This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may <i>look</i> happy, but he's a <i>little</i> disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.</p>

<p>Jack would really like...</p>

<ul>
<li>Roller blades
<li>Magic tricks
<li>Anything Pokemon
<li>A motorized Lego set
</ul>

<p>You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="http://www.etoys.com/">eToys</a>.</p>
