A Python generator is a function which returns a generator iterator (just an object we can iterate over) by calling yield. yield may be called with a value, in which case that value is treated as the "generated" value. The next time next() is called on the generator iterator (i.e. in the next step in a for loop, for example),Rthe generator resumes execution from where it called yield, not from the beginning of the function. All of the state, like the values of local variables, is recovered and the generator contiues to execute until the next call to yield.
When we call a normal Python function, execution starts at function's first line and continues until a return statement, exception, or the end of the function (which is seen as an implicit return None) is encountered. Once a function returns control to its caller, that's it. Any work done by the function and stored in local variables is lost. A new call to the function creates everything from scratch.
